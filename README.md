# Lattice Boltzmann Simulations

## Overview
This repository houses the Lattice Boltzmann Simulation project, an educational endeavor stemming from the "High Performance Computing: Fluid Mechanics with Python" course at the University of Freiburg. It leverages Python, specifically Numpy and Matplotlib, to model and analyze fluid dynamics through various simulation experiments.

## Experiments
- **Shear Wave Decay**:Investigates the decay of sinusoidally initialized density and velocity fields over time, exploring kinematic viscosity's dependence on relaxation factors.


- **Couette Flow**: Models fluid flow in a channel with a moving top wall, comparing the simulation results to analytical expectations.

- **Poiseuille Flow**: Simulates fluid flow driven by a pressure gradient, with results validated against analytical solutions.


- **Sliding Lid**: A variant of Couette flow with specific boundary conditions, including a moving top wall and periodic bounce-back at the sides.
